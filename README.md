**Overview of Feature Engineering**

Objectives:                
1.Extract Additional Features: Generate new features from existing columns, such as the length of the restaurant name or address.             
2.Create New Features by Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations to facilitate analysis and modeling, such as "Has Table Booking" or "Has Online Delivery."       

Key Activities:               
1.Extract Features from Existing Columns:                
*Compute the length of text columns like restaurant name and address.       
*Extract relevant information from existing data columns, such as the number of cuisines offered.              

2.Encode Categorical Variables:                       
*Convert categorical features into binary or numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding)                
*Create binary features indicating the presence of certain attributes, like table booking or online delivery.                                

Technology Used:            
Programming Language:               
*Python: A versatile programming language widely used for data analysis and preprocessing.      

Libraries and Tools:          
*Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, including handling missing values and data type conversions.           
*NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.            
*Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.           
*Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, particularly useful for exploring and understanding the distribution of variables.
